I tested a number of different lag-lead type variables. Below are results from three types:

- No lag or lead

- Average of three years before a crisis start year.

- Average of three years after a crisis starty year.

I also examined Keefer's original 3 year lag-lead variables, but they are basically just a composit of the lag and lead results and are therefore less informative for this exploration.

You can download the most recent Stata formatted version of the data from: []()

The dependent variable is a dummy equalling 1 if 

## No Lag or Lead
```{r, echo=FALSE}
