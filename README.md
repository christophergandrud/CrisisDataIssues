Reassessing data used in the study of political institutions and financial crises.

We currently have two working papers that rely on the source code and data sets included in this repository. 

The first is a largely descriptive paper examining the time dependence and measurement issues in data on political institutions and financial crises. It is available on [SSRN](http://ssrn.com/abstract=2395844). This is purely an exploritory working paper.

The second paper is currently under development. A working paper version will be released in the near future. The paper re-examines the theoretical link between electoral competitiveness and the public costs responding to financial crises. It builds on the model in [Keefer (2007)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0020818307070208) by adding the possibility that policy-makers choose responses that create contingent, as well as immediately realised liabilities. We substantiate this by updating Keefer's key models with new data (the results are consistent with the updated, but not original model) and new data from [Eurostat](http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/government_finance_statistics/excessive_deficit/supplementary_tables_financial_turmoil). 

## Replicate

All of the files needed to construct the basic data set are in the *source/DataCreators* folder, primarily the *KeeferDataExtender.R* file.

All of the files needed to replicate the figures and tables in our second working paper are in the *HowTheySpendIt* folder.
